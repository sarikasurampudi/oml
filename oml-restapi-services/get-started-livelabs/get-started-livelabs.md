# Provision an Autonomous Data Warehouse with OML users

## Introduction

This lab walks to the steps of provisioning an Oracle Autonomous Database, creating an OML-enabled user and signing into Oracle Machine Learning user interface..

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will learn how to:

* Provision an Oracle Autonomous Database
* Create an Oracle Machine Learning user
* Sign into Oracle Machine Learning user interface
* Create the CUSTOMERS360 table.

	> **Note:** You will use this table in the _Using Oracle Machine Learning AutoML UI_ lab and _Using Oracle Machine Learning Services_ lab.

### Prerequisites

* Sign up for a Free Tier Oracle Cloud account.
* Bring your own Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy

> **Note:** You may see differences in account details (eg: Compartment Name is different in different places) as you work through the labs.
