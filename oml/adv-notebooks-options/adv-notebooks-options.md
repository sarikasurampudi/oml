# Advanced Options in Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks 

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to explore the advanced options available in Oracle Machine Learning notebooks.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### About the Advanced options in Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks

Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks offer a wide range of advanced options such as:   

* Notebook Service levels - Allows you to change the notebook type. Notebook type corresponds to the ADB service levels — low, medium, high and gpu. 
* Notebook versioning - Allows archiving your work in a notebook, viewing of version history, and version comparison.
* Comments in notebook paragraphs - Allows you to write comments in notebook paragraphs thereby supporting collaborative work. 
* Notebook Templates - Allows you to create notebooks based on example templates.
* Jobs - Allows you to create jobs to schedule the running of notebooks.
* Paragraph dependencies - Allows you to add runtime sequence dependencies between paragraphs. The child paragraph automatically run after the parent paragraph is run.


### Objectives

In this lab, you will learn how to:
* Change notebook service levels
* Create notebook versions, view version history and compare notebook versions
* Create jobs to schedule notebook run
* Create paragraph dependencies, and run the paragraphs based on paragraph dependency order


### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* An Oracle Machine Learning account
* Access to Oracle Machine Learning USER account.

## Task 1: Change Notebook Service Level

Notebook type corresponds to the ADB service levels — low, medium, high and gpu. These service levels affect parallelism in the database. The notebook type that is set for a notebook applies to all the paragraphs in that notebook. For the notebooks in Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks, you can use the following interpreters:

* SQL interpreter for SQL statements
* PL/SQL  interpreter for PL/SQL scripts/statements
* Python interpreter to process Python scripts
* R interpreter to run R commands and scripts
* md (MarkDown) interpreter for plain text formatting syntax so that it can be converted to HTML.


	> **Note:** The service level that is set for a notebook applies to all the paragraphs in that notebook. 

In this step, you learn how to change the notebook service levels:
1. Go to the Notebooks page by clicking the Cloud menu icon on ![Cloud menu icon](images/cloud-menu-icon.png) the top left corner of the page. On the left navigation menu, click **Notebooks**.
	

	![Notebooks in the left navigation menu](images/left-nav-pane-notebooks.png)

2. On the Notebooks page, click on the **OML4PY Classification_DT** notebook to open it in the Notebook editor. This notebook is created as part of _Task 4 - Create a Notebook using a Template Example_ of the _Oracle Machine Learning Fundamentals on Autonomous Database workshop_.

	![The OML4PY Classification_DT notebook highlighted on the Listing page](images/notebook-list-1.png)
	

3. Click on the **Update Notebook Type** icon ![Update Notebook type icon](images/update-notebook-type-icon.png)on the top right corner. The available notebook types are displayed. The current notebook type is indicated by a tick mark, and is also displayed next to the **Update Notebook Type** icon. 

	![Update Notebook Type icon](images/classification-dt-nbtype-icon.png)

	The Notebook Types (ADB service levels) are: 

	* **low** — Provides the least level of resources for in-database operations, typically serial (non-parallel) execution. It supports the maximum number of concurrent in-database operations by multiple users. The interpreter with low priority is listed at the top of the interpreter list, and hence, is the default.
	* **medium** — Provides a fixed number of CPUs to run in-database operations in parallel, where possible. It supports a limited number of concurrent users, typically 1.25 times the number of CPUs allocated to the pluggable database.
	* **high** — Provides the highest level of CPUs to run in-database operations in parallel, up to the number of CPUs allocated to the pluggable database. It offers the highest performance, but supports the minimum number of concurrent in-database operations, typically 3.
	* **gpu** — Provides GPU compute capabilities in a notebook through the Python interpreter with the database service level set to high. The notebook memory setting is 32 GB (DDR4), by default. It is extensible up to 200 GB.

	![This image shows the Notebook Type icon. It shows the options - Low, Medium, High and gpu. It has the option low highlighted.](images/notebook-type-low.png)

4. To change the notebook type, click on the type that you want to select. In this example, let's click high. A confirmation message is displayed stating: `Notebook Type is updated to "high".`

	![This image shows the Notebook Type icon. It shows the options - Low, Medium, High and gpu. It has the option High highlighted.](images/notebook-type-high.png)

	> **Note:** The updated notebook type is applicable to all the paragraphs in the notebook. You cannot change the notebook type at the paragraph level.

This completes the task of changing notebook service level.

## Task 2: Create Paragraph Dependencies and Run Paragraphs as per Dependency Order

Paragraph Dependencies allow you to add dependencies between paragraphs. The dependent paragraphs automatically run after the original paragraph is run, according to the order of dependency.
To create paragraph dependencies:
1. On the Notebooks page, click **Create**.
2. In the Create Notebooks dialog, enter the name _Paragraph Dependencies Demo_ in the **Name** field and click **OK.** The notebook is created, and it opens in the notebook editor.
3. On the notebook, hover your cursor over the lower border of the paragraph and click the + icon to add a paragraph. Or, click on the **Add SQL Paragraph** icon to call the PL/SQL interpreter.
	![Add PLSQL paragraph icon in an OML Notebook](images/add-sql-script-toolbar.png)
4. In the first paragraph, copy and paste the following PL/SQL script. This script creates the view `ESM_SH_DATA` from the SALES table present in the SH schema.
	```
	<copy>
	CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW ESM_SH_DATA AS
	  SELECT TIME_ID, AMOUNT_SOLD FROM SH.SALES;
	</copy>
	```

5. In the second paragraph, copy and paste the following SQL script. This script gives a count of the record present in the view  `ESM_SH_DATA` .

	```
	<copy>
	SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ESM_SH_DATA;

	</copy>
	```

6. In the third paragraph, copy and paste the following SQL script to review the data in a tabular format.

	```
	<copy>
	SELECT * FROM ESM_SH_DATA
	FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY;

	</copy>
	```

7. Go to the first paragraph and click on the **Enter Dependency Mode** icon.
	![The Enter Dependency Mode icon highlighted in an OML Notebook](images/enter-dep-mode-1.png)

	The message appears: _You are selecting dependents for this paragraph._

8. Click on the second and third paragraph to add them as dependents of paragraph one.

	>**Note:** The order of paragraph dependency is based on the order of your click.

	![This image shows the Paragraph Dependencies notebook with few paragraphs selected to be added as dependent paragraphs.](images/add-dependents.png)

9. Click **Save.**
	![Save Dependents](images/save-dependents.png)

	Once the dependent paragraphs are defined and saved, it is indicated by the numbers as shown in the screenshot here:
	![This image shows the Paragraph Dependencies notebook. It shows the dependent paragraphs along with the dependency order highlighted](images/dep-para-created.png)
10. Now, go to the first paragraph and click the run icon. After the first paragraph starts successfully, the subsequent dependent paragraphs start to run according to the order of dependency.
	![The dependent paragraphs are shown in the Paragraph Dependencies notebook. The run icon is highlighted.](images/run-para-1.png)
	This screenshot shows the successful run of paragraph 1 and 2 (dependent paragraph 1):
	![The dependent paragraphs runs successfully in the Paragraph Dependencies notebook.Paragraphs 1 and 2 run successfully. ](images/para-1-2-run.png)

	This screenshot shows the successful run of paragraph 3 (dependent paragraph 2):
	![This image shows the successful run of the dependent paragraph 3](images/para-3-run.png)

This completes the task of creating paragraph dependencies in a notebook, and run the paragraphs according to the dependency order.  

## Task 3: Create Notebook Versions

By creating versions of your notebook, you can archive your work in a notebook.
You can create versions of notebooks on the notebooks page, as well as in the notebook editor. In this example, the _Paragraph Dependencies Demo_ notebook is used to create versions of it.

>**Note:** A versioned notebook is non-editable. If you want to make any changes to a particular version of a notebook, you must restore that version to edit it.

**Prerequisites:** The _Paragraph Dependencies Demo_ notebook. This notebook is created as part of Task 2 of this lab.

### Task 3.1: Create Versions on the Notebooks page
In this task, you will create Version 1 of the _Paragraph Dependencies Demo_ notebook.
1. On the Notebooks page, select the _Paragraph Dependencies Demo_ notebook to enable all the edit options.
	![This image shows the Notebooks page with the Paragraph Depencies notebook selected. It has all the edit options enabled.](images/nbea-options-enabled.png)
2. Click **Version** to go to the versions page for this notebook.
	![This image shows the Notebooks page with the Paragraph Depencies notebook selected. It has all the edit options enabled, and the Versions option is highlighted.](images/nbea-versions-clicked.png)
3. On the Versions page for this notebook, click **Versions** to open the Create Versions dialog.
	![This image shows the Notebooks versions page of the Paragraph Dependencies notebook.](images/nbea-versions-page.png)

3. In the Create Versions dialog:
	* **Name:** Enter _Version 1_ for the new version of this notebook
	* **Descriptions:** Enter comments, if any.
	* Click **OK.** Once the notebook version is created, it is listed on the Versions - Notebook Versioning Demo page.

	![Create Versions dialog](images/create-version1-dialog.png)
4. On the _Paragraph Dependencies Demo_ page, select **Version 1** of the notebook version that you just created to enable all the available options.
	* Click **Delete** to delete the selected version of the notebook.
	* Click **Restore Version** to restore the selected version of the notebook.
5. Click **Back to Notebooks** to go back to the Notebooks page.

This completes the task of creating a notebook version on the Notebooks page.

### Task 3.2: Create Versions in the Notebooks Editor
By creating versions of your notebook, you can archive your work in a notebook. You can create versions of an open notebook, as well as on the notebooks listing page. In this example:

* The original notebook _Paragraph Dependencies Demo_ is edited to add a script to build a machine learning model.
* The notebook _Paragraph Dependencies Demo_ is then versioned as **Version 2** to archive the code to build the machine learning model.
* The **Version 2** and **Version 1** of the _Paragraph Dependencies Demo_ notebook are compared using the **Compare Versions** feature.


>**Note:** A versioned notebook is non-editable. If you want to make any changes to a particular version of a notebook, you must restore that version to edit it.

To create a new notebook version and view version history:
1. On the Notebooks page, click on the _Paragraph Dependencies Demo_ notebook to open it in the notebook editor.
	> **Note:**  **Version 1** of this notebook is already created as part Task 6.1 in this lab. It contains the archived code to create the view `ESM_SH_DATA`, count the number of records, and view the data. Clicking on the notebook opens the original editable version.

	![The Notebooks page with the Paragraph Dependencies Demo notebook selected. ](images/click-para-dep-nb.png)

2. Now, edit the notebook to add a script to build a machine learning model. On the notebook, hover your cursor over the lower border of the third paragraph, and click the **Add SQL Script Paragraph**  to call the PL/SQL Interpreter.

	![The Add PL/SQL Paragraph icon in a notebook paragraph](images/add-sql-script-toolbar.png)

3. Copy and paste the following script to the new paragraph. This script builds a machine learning model using the ESM algorithm.

	```
	<copy>
		BEGIN DBMS_DATA_MINING.DROP_MODEL('ESM_SALES_FORECAST_1');
	EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN NULL; END;
	/
	DECLARE
	    v_setlst DBMS_DATA_MINING.SETTING_LIST;
	BEGIN

	    v_setlst('ALGO_NAME')            := 'ALGO_EXPONENTIAL_SMOOTHING';
	    v_setlst('EXSM_INTERVAL')        := 'EXSM_INTERVAL_QTR'; -- accumulation int'l = quarter
	    v_setlst('EXSM_PREDICTION_STEP') := '4';                 -- prediction step = 4 quarters
	    v_setlst('EXSM_MODEL')           := 'EXSM_WINTERS';      -- ESM model = Holt-Winters
	    v_setlst('EXSM_SEASONALITY')     := '4';                 -- seasonal cycle = 4 quarters    

	    DBMS_DATA_MINING.CREATE_MODEL2(
	        MODEL_NAME          => 'ESM_SALES_FORECAST_1',
	        MINING_FUNCTION     => 'TIME_SERIES',
	        DATA_QUERY          => 'select * from ESM_SH_DATA',
	        SET_LIST            => v_setlst,
	        CASE_ID_COLUMN_NAME => 'TIME_ID',
	        TARGET_COLUMN_NAME  =>'AMOUNT_SOLD');
	END;
	</copy>
	```
4. Now, archive this notebook along with the code to build the machine learning model by versioning it. On the top left corner of the notebook editor, click the Versioning icon.

	![The Versioning icon highlighted on the Paragraph Dependencies Demo notebook. The notebook is opened in the editor.](images/create-version2.png)

5. The options to **Create Version** and **View Version History** opens. Click **Create Version**.

	![The Versioning icon highlighted on the Paragraph Dependencies Demo notebook. The notebook is opened in the editor. It shows the Create Versions page.](images/create-version-option.png)

6. In the New Version dialog:

	* **Name:** Here, the name Version 2 is taken by default. Let's retain this name.
	* **Description:** Enter notes, if any.
	* Click **Create.**
	![New Version dialog](images/create-version2-dialog.png)
	* A message is displayed confirming the creation of the new version.

	![This image shows the View Version History - Version 2. This is on the right pane in the Paragraph Dependencies Demo notebook. It has the Compare Version option highlighted.](images/click-compare-version.png)
	You can select other available versions from the drop-down list. In this example, **Version 2** of the notebook, which is under Current State is compared with **Version 1**. The new additions are highlighted in green, as shown in the screenshot here.
	![This is the Compare Versions dialog.](images/compare-version.png)
	* Click **Cancel** to exit the dialog.
	* Click **Restore** to restore the selected version.
	>**Note:** Restoring a selected version of the notebook will discard all the unversioned changes, if any.
This completes the task of viewing version history, and comparing notebook versions. 


## Task 4: Create Jobs to Schedule Notebook Run

Jobs allow you to schedule the running of notebooks. On the Jobs page, you can create jobs, duplicate jobs, start and stop jobs, delete jobs, and monitor job status by viewing job logs, which are read-only notebooks. In this lab, you will learn how to create a job to schedule the running of the notebook Classification_DT.

To create a job:

1. Click the Cloud menu icon ![Cloud menu icon](images/cloud-menu-icon.png) on the top left corner of the page to open the left navigation menu, and click **Jobs** to go to the Jobs page.
