# Get started with Oracle Cloud Free Tier Setup

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to set up your Oracle Cloud Free Tier environment that includes provisioning an Oracle Autonomous Database, and signing into Oracle Machine Learning user interface.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will learn how to:

* Provision an Oracle Autonomous Database
* Create an Oracle Machine Learning user
* Sign into Oracle Machine Learning user interface
* Create the CUSTOMERS360 table.

	> **Note:** You will use this table in the _Using Oracle Machine Learning AutoML UI_ lab and _Using Oracle Machine Learning Services_ lab.

### Prerequisites

* Sign up for a Free Tier Oracle Cloud account.

> **Note:** You may see differences in account details (eg: Compartment Name is different in different places) as you work through the labs. This is because the workshop was developed using different accounts over time.
