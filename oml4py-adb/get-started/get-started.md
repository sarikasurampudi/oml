## Task 2: Get familiar with OML Notebooks

We will now download a set of Notebooks that will be used throughout the workshop. It is important that you download and uncompress the collection of Notebooks to a memorable place so that you can find them when it's time to import the files.

> **NOTE:** There is no Notebook for Lab 5, even though you see Lab 5 in the main index of the workshop, because we will be using an interactive UI during that Lab.

  ### About Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks

    A notebook is a web-based interface for data analysis, data discovery, data visualization and collaboration.

    The Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks EA toolbar contains buttons to run code in paragraphs, for configuration settings, and display options.

    For example, it displays the type of Database connection group that the notebook is currently ready to use (low/medium/high), and also the current style of notebook layout (Jupyter vs Zeppelin). It also contains menu items to show or hide the paragraph code, result, titles and settings. Additional settings are shown in the illustration below.

    ![Explanation of the Notebook toolbar](images/notebook_toolbar.png " ")

## Task 3: Getting started with OML Notebooks and interpreter types

1. OML Notebooks contain a default list of interpreter bindings that operate under the different Autonomous Database processing groups.  These interpreter bindings are used to run scripts in the different languages, and it will be processed by the Autonomous Database that it is linked to.  
   
  For this lab, we will **set the processing group type to `low`**, by making sure it is the selected option in the top right of the Notebook when it's open.

  Click the processing group type button in the upper right-corner of the notebook to view the list of available processing group types.
    ![Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks DB Level](images/interpreter_level.png " ")

  The default type is `low`, and you can select among the ones available to your Autonomous Database depending on type of service (Autonomous Datawarehouse or Autonomous Transaction Processing).

  An interpreter is a plug-in that allows you to use a specific data processing language in your Oracle Machine Learning notebook. You can add multiple paragraphs, and each paragraph can be connected to different interpreters such as SQL (%sql), PL/SQL (%script), Python (%python), R (%r) and Conda (%conda).

  You create paragraphs with different interpreters based on the code you want to run, and the interpreter is set at the top of each paragraph.

  The available interpreters are:

  - `%md`&mdash;To call the Markdown interpreter and generate static html from Markdown plain text
  - `%sql`&mdash;To call the SQL interpreter and run SQL statements
  - `%script`&mdash;To call and run PL/SQL scripts
  - `%python`&mdash;To call the Python interpreter and run Python scripts
  - `%r`&mdash;To call the R interpreter and run R scripts.
  - `%conda`&mdash;To connect to the Conda interpreter and install third-party Python and R libraries inside a notebook session.

## Task 4: Use the Python interpreter

1. Let's start by running the entire notebook, so that we can see the result of each paragraph.

   Click on the **Run all paragraphs** (![](images/run-all-paragraphs.png =20x*)) icon in front of the name of the notebook, and then click **Confirm** to run the notebook and refresh the content with your data, as indicated below.

   Another option is to just scroll down and read the pre-recorded results contained in the notebooks themselves.

   ![Run all paragraphs](images/click-run-all-lab1.png " ")

   Scroll down on the "Lab 1" Notebook to follow along the steps below.

   ![Scroll down notebooks to follow along notebook screen capture](images/scroll-down-notebook.png " ")

2. To run Python commands in a notebook, you must make use of the Python interpreter. This occurs as a result of running your first  `%python`  paragraph.  To use OML4Py, you must import the `oml` module, which automatically establishes a connection to your database.

   In an Oracle Machine Learning notebook, you can add multiple paragraphs, and each paragraph can be connected to different interpreters such as SQL, Python or R. This lab shows you how to:

   * Connect to a Python interpreter to run Python commands in a notebook
   * Import the Python modules&mdash;oml, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib
   * Check if the `oml` module is connected to the database

   > **Note:** **`"z"`** is a reserved keyword and must not be used as a variable in `%python` paragraphs in Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks. You will see `z.show()` used in the examples to display Python object and proxy object content.

3. To use OML4Py, you must import the oml module. Type the following Python command to import the `oml` module, and click the **run** icon. Alternatively, you can press Shift+Enter keys to run the current paragraph where the cursor is.   

   ![Python command to import oml module notebook screen capture](images/import_oml.png " ")

4. Using the default interpreter bindings, OML Notebooks automatically establishes a database connection for the notebook.  
   To verify the Python interpreter has established a database connection through the `oml` module, run the command:

   ![Database Connection Verification notebook screen capture](images/oml_connected.png " ")

   Once your notebook is connected, the command returns `True`.         

5. The Python `help` function

   The Python `help` function is used to display the documentation of packages, modules, functions, classes, and keywords.

   Scroll down in the notebook to see examples of the use of the `help` function.

## Task 5: Load sample data into tables and views, and grant access to all users

1. All labs starting from number 2 and above of this workshop use tables and views that need to be created upfront.  To create these tables and views, we will open the Notebook "Lab 1a - Run Me First - OML4Py table creation and grants".

> **NOTE:** If you have problems with downloading and extracting the ZIP file, please [**CLICK HERE** to download the "Lab 1a - Run Me First - OML4Py table creation and grants" notebook DSNB file](<./../notebooks/Lab 1a - Run Me First - OML4Py table creation and grants.dsnb?download=1>). This notebook contains the scripts for creating tables and views, and granting the required access. Save it to your local machine and import it like illustrated in **Task 2, Step 1**.

2. Go back to the main Notebooks page by clicking on the Cloud menu icon ![](images/cloud-menu-icon.png) on the upper left corner of the page to open the left navigation menu.  
   
   ![Go to main Notebooks](images/go-back-to-notebooks-rw.png " ")
3. On the left navigation menu, click **Notebooks**.   

<if type="freetier"> 
 ![Main Menu clicking Lab 1A](images/click-on-lab1a-ft.png " ")
 </if>
 <if type="livelabs"> 
 ![Main Menu clicking Lab 1A](images/click-on-lab1a-ft.png " ")
 </if>
 <if type="freetier-ocw23"> 
 ![Main Menu clicking Lab 1A](images/click-on-lab1a-ft-ocw23.png " ")
 </if>
 <if type="livelabs-ocw23"> 
 ![Main Menu clicking Lab 1A](images/click-on-lab1a-ft-ocw23.png " ")
 </if>

 OML Notebooks will load a session and make the notebook available for editing.

3. Click the **Run all paragraphs** (![](images/run-all-paragraphs.png =20x*)) icon, and then click **Confirm** to run the notebook.
  ![Run the Lab 1a](images/click-run-all.png " ")

   Scroll down, and wait until all the paragraphs have finished running.  You should see a message at the bottom of the last paragraph that contains SQL code (the `%script` one) that reads `"PL/SQL procedure successfully completed"`.

   And at the bottom right, you will see the time it took to run and how long ago it was done.  In the example below it mentions `243ms @ a few seconds ago`, indicating the recent run.

  ![The last paragraph](images/last-paragraph.png " ")

The prerequisite scripts have run successfully.

You can now *proceed to the next lab*.
