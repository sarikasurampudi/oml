# Introduction

## About this workshop
This workshop introduces you to Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py) on Oracle Autonomous Database.
Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py) supports scalable in-database data exploration and preparation using native Python syntax, scalable in-database algorithms for machine learning model building and scoring, and automated machine learning (AutoML). Users can also invoke user-defined Python functions from Python and REST APIs using database-spawned Python engines. OML4Py increases data scientist productivity and reduces solution deployment complexity.  Join us for this tour of OML4Py.

Python is a major programming language used for data science and machine learning. OML4Py is a feature on Oracle Autonomous Database that provides Python users access to powerful in-database functionality supporting data scientists for both scalability, performance, and ease of solution deployment.

### About Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py)
Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py) is a component of Oracle Autonomous Database, which includes Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), and Oracle Autonomous JSON Database (AJD). By using Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks on Oracle Autonomous Database, you can run Python functions on database data for exploration, preparation, and modeling while leveraging Oracle Database as a high-performance computing environment.

Watch the video below for an introduction to Oracle Machine Learning for Python.

### Prerequisites

- An Oracle Cloud Account. Please view this workshop's LiveLabs landing page to see which environments are supported
- Some knowledge in statistics and Python programming is helpful

> **Note:** If you have a Free Trial account, when your Free Trial expires your account will be converted to an **Always Free** account. You will not be able to conduct Free Tier workshops unless the Always Free environment is available. **[Click here for the Free Tier FAQ page.](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/faq.html)**
