# Use AutoML

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to use the AutoML functionality.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### About AutoML
AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) provides built-in data science expertise about data analytics and modeling that you can employ to build machine learning models.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will learn how to:
* Create a Pandas DataFrame (OML DataFrame) proxy object for the `CUSTOMER_INSURANCE_LTV` database table to predict who would buy insurance based on the current customer behavior
* Use `automl.AlgorithmSelection` to rank the in-database algorithms by predicted score metric for classification of the BUY_INSURANCE target
* Use `automl.FeatureSelection` to identify the most relevant feature subset for the training data and the selected algorithm
* Use `automl.ModelTuning` to tune selected algorithm hyperparameters
* Use `automl.ModelSelection` to select the top in-database algorithm and return the tuned model in a single function

### Prerequisites

1. We need to access and run the OML notebook for this lab.

    > **NOTE:** If you have problems with downloading and extracting the ZIP file in Lab 1 Task 2, please

This notebook contains the scripts for this Lab. Save it to your local machine and import it like illustrated in **Lab 1, Task 2, Step 1**.

    Go back to the main Notebooks page by clicking on the Cloud menu icon ![](images/cloud-menu-icon.png) on the upper left of the screen to open the left navigation pane, and then click **Notebooks**.

    OML Notebooks will create a session and make the notebook available for editing.

    You can optionally click the **Run all paragraphs** (![](images/run-all-paragraphs.png =20x*)) icon, and then click **Confirm** to refresh the content with your data, or just scroll down and read the pre-recorded results.
